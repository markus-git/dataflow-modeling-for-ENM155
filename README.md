# dataflow-modeling-for-ENM155

This repository provides a skeleton of the data-flow modelling part in course ENM155. It is written in Java and supports:

  * Generating graphs from a JSON file.
  * Performing graph-based algorithms.
  * Visualisation of graphs through dot files.

An example of the entire development process, that is, writing a configuration file, generating a graph from that file and outputting an input/output solution, can be found in the class `Main`. Be sure to read through the example to get an general idea of how the library works.

## Writing configuration files.

Reading JSON files is supported by the classes found under `enm155/src/json`. Understanding these classes is not required in order to complete the assignment, but helpful comments are included if you wish to extend them for the assignment’s second part. The important part is how to write such files.

An example configuration file is inculded under `enm155/example`, but the general idea is to wrap objects in `{}`, arrays in `[]` and bind key-value mappings by writing `“key” : value`. Multiple mappings are supported by separating them by a `,`.

Once the configuration file has been parsed, as shown by `readExample` in `Main`, a graph can be generated. Again, an example of to do this is included under `parseExample` in `Main`.

## Performing graph-based algorithms.

Once a configuration file has read and parsed, the generated graph is ready to be used for calculating input/output requirements.

Graphs are specified by the interfaces `Graph`, `Vertex`, and `Edge` found under `enm155/src/graph`. An implementation of these can be found under `enm155/src/graph/directed`. Make sure to read through these and understand them. An implementation of the input/output algorithm can be found under `calculateDemands` in `MyGraph`.

## Visualisation of graphs.

In order to avoid having to depend on Java libraries for visualising graphs we make use of the DOT language. DOT is a plain text graph description language and provides a simple way of describing graphs.

DOT files can be generated by running the `generateDot`command found in `MyGraph`. Once generated, these can be visualised by various programs. Another option is to use [this](http://webgraphviz.com/) webpage, which allows you to view dot graphs in your browser.
